Hence, we want to analyze the correlation between climate change and the death from cancer.

1. We narrowed down our analysis to 5 top countries with highest population in the world: China, India, United States, Indonesia, and Brazil.
2. Pull the data of average temperature from 1991 to 2016 by each countries.
3. Pull the data of CO2 emission by each countries from 1991 to 2016. This data will show how much pollution each countries has year by year.
4. Pull the data of deaths from cancer from 1991 to 2016 by each countries, by cancer types. (We may want to focus on lung cancer).
